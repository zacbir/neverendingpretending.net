I know in my work life as in my private life, I’ve caused myself a lot of
suffering by overanalyzing the beginning of something. Over the course of 2020
and 2021, my RPG hobby resurrected in a big way. I’ve spent a lot of time over
the past two years thinking about what makes gaming fun for me and hopefully for
the people at my table. I’ve spoken about a lot of it with folks in voice chats,
but never properly put thought to word. 

Until now.

My number one intention for this blog is to act as a repository for what I hope
to be a useful resource for folks who want to tackle settings and adventures for
crunchier systems in a more minimalist way.

Welcome to Neverending Pretending!
