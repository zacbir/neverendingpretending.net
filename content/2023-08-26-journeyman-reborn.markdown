After stewing on the previous incarnation of Journeyman, I decided to strip it
down to the bone and build it back up to something I think is a light,
extensible, and expressive framework that can support any number of settings and
genres.

I had a few guiding principles. It needed:

**A consistent way to resolve tasks when randomness is needed.**

I wanted to avoid minigames and multiple, sometimes inconsistent, subsystems
for different aspects of the game. "2d6, roll high" is an extremely simple
concept to keep in mind for task resolution.

**As little character quantification as possible.**

I enjoy games that take a more literary approach to character design, and I
wanted to see what players could come up with in an unbounded playing field.

**No power bloat.**

The protagonists in stories I enjoy rarely get tremendously more powerful as
time goes on. Typically, they improve by getting new equipment or gaining
allies. I wanted to have a game that explored that kind of growth without such
a focus on increasing numbers on the character sheet.

**No reliance on any dice beyond d6.**

Admittedly, this is a purely stylistic stance. I collect all sorts of dice,
and enjoy chucking them when I can, but I relish the simplicity of the d6 and
wanted to hew close to the Traveller roots.

*[I love you, too, d12, we all know you're the perfect polyhedral die.]*

So, I've released its new incarnation, and you can download it on my [itch.io
