# Introducing Divers Hazards
I love Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay. Been a fan of it since its first edition back in 1986. In high school and college, I collected the original Enemy Within books as they came out, and I never had a group willing to commit to such a long campaign. Fast forward 30 years, and I've accumulated a lot of the fourth edition, including the Collector's Editions of the newly revisited Enemy Within campaign.
