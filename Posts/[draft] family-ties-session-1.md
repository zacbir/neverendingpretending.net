I recently started getting more interested in [Ironsworn](https://ironswornrpg.com) as the engine for some solo roleplaying. But instead of running in the quasi-Medieval Ironlands setting, I wanted to try a modern urban horror game. Based on some recommendations and feedback, I chose to use the new [Starforged](https://www.ironswornrpg.com/product-ironsworn-starforged) system, just modifying some of the assets and tables in play.

For setting and mood, I chose the modern world of [Kult: Divinity Lost](https://kultdivinitylost.com) and set my story in a fictionalized version of Richmond, Virginia. For the purposes of a solo game, I felt it would be best to play as a Sleeper character, slowly coming to the realization that the world around him is an illusion, and occasionally gaining glimpses past the Veil.
